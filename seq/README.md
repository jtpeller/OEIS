# Sequences

This folder contains all the sequences that have been programmed.

The naming convention for these files is as follows:

- `thru100.go` -- contains all sequences that have been programmed through A000100
- `thru200.go` -- contains all sequences that have been programmed from A000100 through A000200

And so on.

Note: otherseq.go contains programmed sequences that don't yet fit in a file. These are typically
sequences that I accidentally programmed while trying to program another sequence.
