# Sequences

## Contents 

This folder contains all the sequences that have been programmed.

The naming convention for these files is as follows:

- `thru100.go` -- contains all sequences that have been programmed through A000100
- `thru200.go` -- contains all sequences that have been programmed from A000100 through A000200

And so on.

## Other contents

- `bignum.go` -- contains code to make golang's arbitrary precision easier to use
- `otherseq.go` -- contains any sequences that don't yet have their corresponding file made yet. For instance, A032346 doesn't have its `thru32400.go` file yet. These sequences are either very useful sequences, or sequences that I accidentally programmed while trying to program another sequence.
- `Sequences.xlsx` -- File I use to maintain which sequences have been written or not.
